          Every gas has a different origin and source. It is important to know,
          where the gases come from, in order to reduce them directly at the
          source.

              <strong>Carbon dioxide</strong>
               is largely produced by the burning of fossil fuels such
              as coal, oil and gas, for example for power generation, in industry,
              domestic heating systems and in road traffic. In addition, as a result
              of deforestation, CO2 is released by the decomposition of biomass during
              the burning of mainly tropical forests. Lignite-fired power plants emit
              about 20 percent of the total German CO2 emissions.

              <strong>Methane</strong>
               is always produced when organic material is decomposed in the
              absence of oxygen; this occurs mainly in the stomachs of ruminants
              (cows and sheep), in wet rice cultivation and in landfills. For
              example, a cow produces about 150 to 250 litres of methane.

              <strong>Laughing gas</strong>
               is produced in the soil during the decomposition of
              mineral nitrogen fertilizers. It is the most important greenhouse
              gas released by agriculture worldwide.Â The use of land and fertilizers
              leads to a significant release of CO2 and nitrous oxide.

              <strong>F-Gases</strong>
               are mainly used as propellants and refrigerants,
              their use has been greatly reduced since 1990 as they contribute
              to the destruction of the ozone layer; the fluorocarbons (HFCs)
              used as substitutes do not damage the ozone layer - but
              they are also greenhouse gases.
